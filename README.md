# Four_in_line_Game

In your conversion, the board dimensions will be entered at the beginning of the program.For the game to be valid, both the width and the height of the playing field must be at least 4, but in order to be able to display it well on the screen, the height is not more than 20 and the width is not more than 40.

Then begins the actual game, in which the moves of the two players alternate. One by one, they must enter a column number in which to place their tokens. The program must validate the correctness of the move, display the current playing field on the screen and then, if the player has won, announce the victory with an appropriate message. These steps are repeated until the end of the game (with a single player winning or ending in a draw).
